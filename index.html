        <p>
          When you live and work across borders your budget needs get
          more complex. If you are an Expat, Diplomat, or just someone
          who works with more than one currency this is the budget
          site for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Family Budgets are hard at the best of times, when you are
          dealing with several currencies, and foreign settings they
          get harder. Our easy to use tools can help everyone get on
          the same page with money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most budget tools assume that your income and expenses are
          all in the same currency, but if you live in Europe but are
          renting a house in the USA, or are working abroad but being
          paid in dollars they will fail you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Global budget has been built by long term expats who
          understand what it is to live around the world. We know that
          life is complex and that an exchange rate moving can cause
          your budget to go out of whack (or suddenly have a lot of
          wiggle room). We make tools to match.
